    <p class="textbox">description:You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go back to
        the traditionally 'boiled' beef. <br> This recipe was given to my mother-in-law during WWII by her Jewish
        boarding house owner and it has become a treasured family recipe.<br> Unlike the commonly boiled corned beef,
        this is a slow braise that is tender, flavorful, and has a caramelized surface when it's done. <br> I serve it
        with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips. It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish
        dinner, but we love it <br> so much that I cook it year around. </p>
