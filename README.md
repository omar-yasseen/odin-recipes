odin recipes

in this project ill try to demonstrate the skills that i learned in html portion of the odin course. although i haven't went throught it all
since i already am studying html in college, but when i get stuck ill go back and relearn what i thought i had learned but in fact forgot.

1-testing github workflow by adding this line.

2-another test to cement the idea of git adding to stage/committing/then pushing to the main branch.

3- ok i got the commands down and they go as follows:-
a)git add README.md
b)git commit -m "Edit README.md"
c)git push

so far i learned how to use github.

apparently the "git commit -m "text"" the text part is the commit message.

i finished all the odin project html and css.
and i made the odin recipe web pages(brisket and mac&cheese) to show what i have learned to do.
