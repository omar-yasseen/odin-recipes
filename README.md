odin recipes

in this project ill try to demonstrate the skills that i learned in html portion of the odin course. although i haven't went throught it all
since i already am studying html, but when i get stuck ill go back and relearn what i thought i had learned.

1-testing github workflow by adding this line.

2-another test to cement the idea of git adding to stage/committing/then pushing to the main branch.
